#MoleWhack
This is a lesson teaching simple HTML, CSS and Javascript to implement a Whack-A-Mole like game for a single web page.

This lesson uses tag identities for CSS formatting and uses document.getElementByID() to access the DOM to manipulate element position, content and visibility. Only four elements are used.
